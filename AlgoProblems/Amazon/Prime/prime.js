/// You are working on developing a movie with Amazon Video and want to devise an application to easily break up individual shots 
/// (short sequence from a particular camera angle) in a video into scenes (a sequence of shots).  
/// Each shot is labeled with a letter. There is already an algorithm that breaks the video up into shots and labels them.
/// Write a function which will partition a sequence of shots into minimal subsequences 
/// so that no shot appears in more than one subsequence. The output should be the length of each subsequence.

/// Input
/// The input to the function/method consists of an argument - inputList, a list of characters representing the sequence of shots.
/// Output
/// Return a list of integers representing the length of each scene, in the order in which it appears in the given sequence of shots.
/// Example 1:
/// inputList = [a, b, c]
/// Output = [1, 1, 1]
/// Explanation:
/// Because there are no recurring shots, all shots can be in the minimal length 1 subsequence.
/// Example 2:
/// inputList  = [a, b, c, a]
/// Output = [4]
/// Explanation:
/// Because ‘a’ appears more than once, everything between the first and last appearance of ‘a’ must be in the same list.
/// Example 3:
/// inputList = [a, b, a, b, c, b, a, c, a, d, e, f, e, g, d, e, h, i, j, h, k, l, i, j]
/// Output = [9, 7, 8]
/// Test 1:
/// Input = [a, b, c, d, a, e, f, g, h, i, j, e]
/// Output = 5 7
/// Test 2:
/// [z, z, c, b, z, c, h, f, i, h, i]
/// Output = 6 5
